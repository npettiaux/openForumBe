##Biography 

Bernard Rentier is the former rector of [Université de Liège (ULG)](http://ulg.ac.be) and a champion 
of [OpenAccess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAccess) in his university. He succeeded in
having the researchers themselves published all their works, as soon as possible, openly and
freely accessible on the intutitional repository [Orbi](http://orbi.ulg.ac.be), hece gaining
much visibility and increasing their citation, while also allowing the university
to get a much more precise value for the number of published works by the members of the university,
and considerably higher than expected.
