##Biographical sketch 

[Marius Gilbert](http://lubies.ulb.ac.be/mgilbert.html) graduated in 
Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences at the 
[Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB)](http://ulb.ac.be) in 1995, he was a visiting researcher for two 
years at the [department of Zoology, University of Oxford](http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/) , and 
finished his PhD on in insect pest ecology at the ULB in 2001. 
He was then a post-doctoral fellow at the [Fonds National de la 
Recherche Scientifique (FNRS, Brussels, Belgium)](http://frs-fnrs.be/) for three years, 
followed by three years or research at the ULB on contract research. 
In 2006, he was awarded a *Research Associate* permanent academic 
position with the Belgian FNRS, hosted at the 
[Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB)](http://ulb.ac.be) and has since 
worked to animate and develop his research 
group in spatial epidemiology.

####Short abstract

High spatial resolution  data on the geographical distribution of 
populations have countless uses ranging from epidemics modelling 
to disaster management and environmental impact assessment. People 
and livestock also have a profound impact on the environment, which 
can be spatially informed thanks to high quality data on their 
number and distribution. Since several years, two different 
projects have aimed to collect, integrate and redistribute spatial 
data on people and livestock at continental and global scale. The 
Worldpop project initially aimed to process and disseminate human 
population spatial data in developing countries at a 100m spatial 
resolution, and has now expanded to distribute data on human movement 
patterns. The gridded livestock of the world (GLW) project was 
initiated by FAO and now covers six livestock species, at a global 
extent, and a spatial resolution of 1 km per pixel. Since their origin, 
both projects have adopted an Open data approach, and have been 
extensively used in epidemiological,  environmental and socio-economic 
applications.
