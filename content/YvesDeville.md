##Title
Open Education:  towards open digital learning resources
Yves Deville and Olivier Bonaventure, Université catholique Louvain

###Short abstract
Open Education introduces, in the field of learning, an open approach 
with collaboration and knowledge sharing.  In terms of content, 
Open education proposes to promote the development and use of 
open educational resources, that is learning materials in a digital 
format freely distributed to educators, students or any individual 
around the world. Digital opens the door to new types of educational 
materials and facilitates dissemination. MOOCs are a possible 
implementation of the Open Education, but other digital technologies 
can also be offered.

The first part of the talk will present and discuss Open Education.

In the second part,  (Olivier Bonaventure)[OlivierBonaventure.md] will present his experience 
with three open ebooks.
