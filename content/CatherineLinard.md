##Biographical sketch 

[Catherine Linard](http://lubies.ulb.ac.be/clinard.html) 
graduated in Geographical Sciences at the 
[Université catholique de Louvain (UCL)](http://www.uclouvain.be/), Belgium, in 2005. 
She completed her PhD thesis on spatial and integrated 
modelling of complex disease systems at the Department of 
Geography of the UCL in January 2009 and was then visiting 
researcher for 4 months at the [department of Zoology (TALA research group), 
University of Oxford](http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/). She was then a 
post-doctoral fellow of the Wiener-Anspach Foundation for two 
years at the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford, f
ollowed by four years (2011-2015) as post-doctoral fellow of the 
[Fonds National de la 
Recherche Scientifique (FNRS, Brussels, Belgium)](http://frs-fnrs.be/) 
at the [Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB)](http://ulb.ac.be). She is now sharing her time between an half-time 
academic position at the department of Geography of the [University 
of Namur](http://unamur.be) and a half-time researcher position at the ULB.

####Short abstract

High spatial resolution  data on the geographical distribution of 
populations have countless uses ranging from epidemics modelling 
to disaster management and environmental impact assessment. People 
and livestock also have a profound impact on the environment, which 
can be spatially informed thanks to high quality data on their 
number and distribution. Since several years, two different 
projects have aimed to collect, integrate and redistribute spatial 
data on people and livestock at continental and global scale. The 
Worldpop project initially aimed to process and disseminate human 
population spatial data in developing countries at a 100m spatial 
resolution, and has now expanded to distribute data on human movement 
patterns. The gridded livestock of the world (GLW) project was 
initiated by FAO and now covers six livestock species, at a global 
extent, and a spatial resolution of 1 km per pixel. Since their origin, 
both projects have adopted an Open data approach, and have been 
extensively used in epidemiological,  environmental and socio-economic 
applications.
